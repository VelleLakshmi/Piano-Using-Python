# Piano-Using-Python
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Python GUI Piano project. Within this project, we're set to construct an interactive piano interface leveraging various Python libraries. The project's centrepiece will revolve around utilizing the Tkinter library to craft the graphical user interface (GUI).

As the project's title suggests, this endeavour will encompass a set of piano keys. By interacting with these keys through clicks, corresponding sounds will be generated. For sound playback, we'll harness the capabilities of the mixer module from the pygame library.

## Project Highlights:
- Development of frame widgets
- Creation of piano keynotes as interactive buttons
- Integration of sound elements

## Getting Started:
To embark on this project, we'll commence by importing the essential libraries. Our initial steps will involve instantiating a tkinter frame using `Tk()`. Within this, we'll define the title and dimensions of our GUI window via the `.title()` and `.geometry()` methods. Additionally, we'll tailor the window's background colour using the `.configure(background=< colour name>)` function.

We're excited to delve into this project, and we invite you to explore our codebase, contribute, and potentially extend the functionalities as we journey together through the world of interactive Python programming.
